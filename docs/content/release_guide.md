# Release Guide

This guide describes the process to create a GitHub Release for this project.

1. [Create and push a Git tag](#create-and-push-a-git-tag)
1. [Add release notes](#add-release-notes)
1. [Create a Helm chart release](#create-a-helm-chart-release)
1. [Announce the new release](#announce-the-new-release)

## Create and push a Git tag

```console
$ export RELEASE_VERSION=<release-version> # ex: export RELEASE_VERSION=v0.1.0
$ git tag -a "$RELEASE_VERSION" -m "<add description here>"
$ git push origin "$RELEASE_VERSION"
```

A [GitHub Action](/.github/workflows/release.yml) is triggered when the tag is pushed.
It will build the CLI binaries, publish a new GitHub release,
upload the packaged binaries and checksums as release assets,
and build and push Docker images for OSM and the demo to the
[`openservicemesh` organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/openservicemesh) on Docker Hub.

## Add release notes

In the description section of the new release, add information about feature additions, bug fixes,
and any other administrative tasks completed on the repository.

## Create a Helm chart release

* set the container image tag in `charts/osm/values.yaml` and `charts/osm/Chart.yaml`
* bump the chart version in `charts/osm/Chart.yaml`
* create a PR with the above changes and merge it to main
* create a Git tag from main in the format `chart/x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the chart version
* push the Git tag to origin
* GitHub Actions runs [helm-gh-pages](https://github.com/stefanprodan/helm-gh-pages) that packages the charts, updates `index.yaml` and pushes the changes to `gh-pages` branch
* GitHub Pages publishes the new version, making the chart available at `https://openservicemesh.github.io/osm`

## Announce the new release

Make an announcement on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/openservicemesh).

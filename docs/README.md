# Development

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing). There is [an issue](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/250#issuecomment-614158889) with the Sidebar menu breaking in certain later versions - I recommend installing the [68.3 release](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.68.3)
